# Boat_Sounds_Classification
Classification of boat sounds audio using deep learning

## Database

This contribution presents a database of underwater sounds produced by vessels of various types. Besides sound recordings, the database contains details of the conditions for obtaining each recording: type of vessel, location of the recording equipment, weather conditions, etc. For its realization, a methodology for recording sounds and gathering additional information has been established, that will facilitate its use to the research community, and expanding the number of records in the database in the future.

The sounds are recorded in shallow waters and in real conditions. Therefore, the recordings contain both natural and anthropogenic environment noise. It aims to provide a database of real sounds that researchers can use, for example, to train boat detectors and classifiers, usable in monitoring maritime traffic.
